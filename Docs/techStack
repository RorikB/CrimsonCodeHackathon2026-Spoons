🏆 Best Stack for Local Smart Mirror
🥇 Python + PyQt (or Tkinter if needed)

This gives you:

Fullscreen desktop UI

Direct mic access

Local voice processing

Clean windowed dashboard

Easy future deployment to Raspberry Pi

No browser. No server. No API routing.

Everything runs in one app.

🧠 Recommended Language Choice
👉 Use Python for Everything

Why?

Voice recognition → Python friendly

TTS → Python friendly

Weather API → Python requests

Timer logic → Easy

Desktop UI → PyQt

Later Pi deployment → Python runs natively

This removes cross-language complexity.

🖥 UI Framework Options
🥇 Option 1: PyQt6 (Best Choice)

Modern
Customizable
Looks professional
Good for fullscreen dashboard

Install:

pip install PyQt6
🥈 Option 2: Tkinter

Built into Python
Simpler
Less modern looking

Works, but less polished.

🥉 Option 3: Kivy

Cool but steeper learning curve.

For 24 hours → PyQt is ideal.

Everything runs inside one process.

🧠 Core System Design
1️⃣ Main UI Loop

Fullscreen black window

Clock widget

Weather widget

Calendar widget

Timer widget

2️⃣ Background Voice Thread

Constantly listens

Converts speech → text

Sends command to handler

3️⃣ Command Router

Parses text

Updates UI state

Triggers TTS

No HTTP. No REST.

Just function calls.

🎤 Voice Setup (Local)
Speech-to-Text Options:
🥇 Option A: OpenAI Whisper API

Easy and accurate
Requires internet

🥈 Option B: Local Whisper (faster-whisper)

Works offline
Heavier setup

For hackathon reliability → use API.

🔊 Text-to-Speech (Local)

Use:

pip install pyttsx3

No internet required.
Works instantly.

🌦 Weather

Use requests:

pip install requests

Pull from OpenWeather API.
Update every 10–15 minutes.

🕒 Timer

Simple Python threading or QTimer inside PyQt.

👥 Team Role Split (Updated For Local App)
👤 Person 1 — UI (PyQt)

Fullscreen window

Layout

Clock

Weather display

Timer display

👤 Person 2 — Voice System

Mic capture

Whisper integration

Background listening thread

👤 Person 3 — Logic Engine

Command parsing

Timer management

Weather fetching

Calendar data

👤 Person 4 — Integration + Polish

Connect voice to UI

Add TTS

Handle state updates

Smooth animations

No one overlaps heavily.

🖥 Fullscreen Mode Example (PyQt)

You’ll do something like:

self.showFullScreen()

Black background.
White text.
Large clock.

That’s your mirror.

⚡ Why This Is The Right Decision

Because:

It runs offline

No web browser dependency

Easy to port to Raspberry Pi later

No frontend/backend sync issues

Fewer moving parts

Less failure risk during demo

This is now a real embedded prototype, not a website.

🏁 What You Should Install Right Now

Everyone:

pip install PyQt6
pip install requests
pip install pyttsx3

Voice person also:

pip install openai
🚀 Next Step
