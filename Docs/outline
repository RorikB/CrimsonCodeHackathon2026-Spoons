Perfect. Let’s turn this into a clear 24-hour execution plan your team can actually follow.

We’re building:

🪞 AI Life Dashboard Mirror (Voice-First MVP)
🎯 MVP Features

Fullscreen dashboard UI

Digital clock

Weather

Calendar (basic)

Voice commands

Timer

Text-to-speech responses

No face detection. No wake word (unless extra time).

👥 TEAM ROLE BREAKDOWN
👤 Person 1 — Frontend Dashboard
👤 Person 2 — Voice + Speech Recognition
👤 Person 3 — Backend + APIs
👤 Person 4 — AI + TTS + Integration

Everyone works in parallel.

⏳ 24-HOUR EXECUTION PLAN
🔵 PHASE 1 (Hour 0–2): Setup + Foundation
1️⃣ Decide Stack

Recommended stack:

Frontend: React (Vite or Next)

Backend: FastAPI (Python)

Speech-to-text: Whisper API or local faster-whisper

Text-to-speech: pyttsx3 (local) or OpenAI TTS

Weather: OpenWeather API

Calendar: Google Calendar OR mock data

2️⃣ Repo Setup

Create GitHub repo

Create branches:

frontend-ui

voice-system

backend-api

ai-logic

🔵 PHASE 2 (Hour 2–6): Build Static Dashboard
👤 Frontend Dev
Build:

Fullscreen black background

Large digital clock (top center)

Weather section (top left)

Calendar section (right side)

Timer section (bottom)

Make it look futuristic:

Thin white font

Minimal UI

Smooth fade transitions

This alone makes demo impressive.

🔵 PHASE 3 (Hour 4–8): Weather Integration
👤 Backend Dev

Create /weather endpoint

Fetch weather from API

Return:

Temperature

Condition

High/Low

Frontend polls every 10–15 minutes.

This is an early “win.”

🔵 PHASE 4 (Hour 6–10): Calendar
Option A (Safe MVP)

Hardcode demo events:

[
  {"time": "10:00 AM", "event": "Team Standup"},
  {"time": "2:00 PM", "event": "Hackathon Judging"},
  {"time": "5:00 PM", "event": "Workout"}
]
Option B (Advanced)

Use Google Calendar API.

Only do this if someone is confident with OAuth.

Display:

Today’s date

Next 3 events

🔵 PHASE 5 (Hour 8–14): Voice System

This is your differentiator.

👤 Voice Dev
Step 1 — Capture Audio

Use browser mic OR Python mic capture

Step 2 — Speech to Text

Send audio to:

Whisper API

Return text string.

👤 Backend Dev
Step 3 — Intent Parser

Simple keyword matching:

if "weather" in text:
    intent = "weather"
elif "schedule" in text or "calendar" in text:
    intent = "calendar"
elif "timer" in text:
    intent = "timer"
elif "time" in text:
    intent = "clock"

Don’t overcomplicate.

🔵 PHASE 6 (Hour 12–16): Timer System

Timer commands:

“Start a 5 minute timer”

“Set timer for 10 minutes”

Extract number from string.

Start countdown in backend.
Send state to frontend.
Display countdown visually.

Add:

Flash animation when done

Audio notification

Judges love visual feedback.

🔵 PHASE 7 (Hour 14–18): Text-to-Speech
👤 AI / TTS Dev

After command runs, respond verbally:

Examples:

Weather:

“It’s 42 degrees and cloudy in Pullman.”

Calendar:

“You have three events today. Your next event is Team Standup at 10 AM.”

Timer:

“Starting a five minute timer.”

Clock:

“It is 9:42 PM.”

This makes it feel alive.

🔵 PHASE 8 (Hour 18–22): Polish + Integration

Now combine everything.

Test flow:

Speak command

Transcript appears

Dashboard updates

Mirror speaks response

Fix:

Latency issues

UI flicker

Error handling

Add subtle animations.

🔵 PHASE 9 (Hour 22–24): Demo Prep

Polish > Features.

Script demo:

“Mirror, what’s the weather?”

“Mirror, what’s on my schedule?”

“Start a two minute timer.”

Show timer countdown

Let it ring

🧠 Clean Command List (Keep It Small)

Support only:

What time is it?

What’s the weather?

What’s on my schedule?

Start a ___ minute timer.

That’s it.

🏆 What Makes This Win

You must frame it properly:

Say:

“We reinvented the mirror by turning it into a voice-first AI dashboard that replaces your phone during your morning routine.”

NOT:

“We made a smart mirror.”

🚨 Risk Management

If voice is buggy:

Add clickable buttons as backup.

Never rely 100% on speech for demo.

📦 Final Deliverable Checklist

Before submission:

 Clock working

 Weather auto updates

 Calendar visible

 Voice command recognized

 Timer works

 Text-to-speech works

 Clean UI

 Demo rehearsed

If you want next, I can:

Give you a folder structure layout

Write example intent parsing code

Help you design the UI layout

Help you build a realistic 3-minute pitch

Help you design stretch goals if you finish early
