No 2-way mirror film? Totally fine. Just use:

A vertical monitor

Dark background

Minimal UI

Dim room lighting

It will still look like a “smart mirror” in demo.

🎯 MVP: AI Life Dashboard Mirror (Voice-First Version)

We’re going to define a tight, achievable 24-hour scope.

You said you want:

Weather

Calendar

Clock / Timer

Voice detection

Face detection later

Perfect.

Let’s design this properly.

🧠 Clear MVP Concept
🔄 What You’re Reinventing:

The morning dashboard.

Instead of checking:

Phone

Calendar app

Weather app

Timer app

You just say:

“Mirror, what’s my day look like?”

And it responds.

That’s your hook.

🏗 Core Architecture (Simple + Powerful)
🎤 Voice Input

Speech-to-text (Whisper API or local model)

Command parser

🧠 Command Router

Detects intent:

“What’s the weather?”

“Start a 5 minute timer.”

“What’s on my calendar?”

“What time is it?”

🖥 Frontend Dashboard

Always shows:

Clock

Weather

Next calendar event

Then updates dynamically when commands are spoken.

🧱 MVP Feature Breakdown
1️⃣ Digital Clock (Super Easy Win)

Always visible.
Large.
Clean.

This instantly makes it feel real.

2️⃣ Weather (AUTO-LOCATION: Pullman, WA)

Since you're in Pullman, we’ll use that.

You need a weather widget.
So we will render it properly.

Calling the weather widget now.

(Weather should default to Pullman, WA unless overridden.)

This alone makes it feel polished.

3️⃣ Calendar (Simple Version)

Don’t overcomplicate with full Google OAuth unless you’re confident.

For MVP:

Either:

Pre-load demo events

OR use Google Calendar API if someone is comfortable with OAuth

Display:

Next 3 events

Highlight current day

4️⃣ Voice Commands (Core Differentiator)

This is where you impress judges.

Supported Commands:

“What time is it?”

“What’s the weather?”

“What’s on my schedule today?”

“Start a 5 minute timer.”

“Set a 10 minute focus timer.”

That’s enough.

Do NOT build conversational AI yet.
Just structured commands.

👥 4-Person Team Split (Clean Branching)
👤 1 — Frontend Engineer

Fullscreen UI

Clock component

Weather display

Calendar component

Timer animation

👤 2 — Voice Engineer

Microphone capture

Whisper / speech-to-text

Parse commands

Send intent to backend

👤 3 — Backend Engineer

Command routing

Timer logic

Weather API

Calendar API

State management

👤 4 — AI / UX Engineer

Text-to-speech response

Polished responses

Smooth UX transitions

Demo scripting

Stretch goals (LLM summarization)

Everyone has real responsibility.

⚡ Stretch Goals (Only After Core Works)

If MVP works early:

“Summarize my day.”

“Give me a productivity tip.”

“What should I prioritize?”

Face recognition profile switching

Wake-word detection (“Hey Mirror”)

🛑 What NOT To Do

Do NOT:

Overbuild authentication

Try to build full conversational AI

Try to integrate 10 APIs

Spend 6 hours debugging OAuth

Win by:

Clean

Stable

Responsive

Polished demo

🏆 How You Pitch This

Say:

“We reinvented the wheel by reinventing the morning routine. Instead of reaching for your phone, your mirror becomes your AI dashboard.”

Then demo:

Stand in front

“Mirror, what’s my day?”

It speaks

It displays calendar + weather

Start timer

Timer visually counts down

That wins.
