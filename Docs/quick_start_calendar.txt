CALENDAR QUICK START GUIDE
==========================

Choose your path based on setup time:

PATH 1: LOCAL .ICS FILE (30 seconds, no setup)
===============================================

STEP 1: Export your calendar
1. Google Calendar: calendar.google.com → Settings → Import & Export → Export
2. Outlook: Open Calendar → File → Save Calendar as .ics
3. Apple Calendar: File → Export → Export calendar

STEP 2: Move the file to the project folder
Just drag the .ics file into the project folder

STEP 3: Run it
powershell
python whats_my_day_like.py your_calendar.ics
```

Done! You'll see your calendar events printed.

Pros: ✓ Zero setup, ✓ Works offline
Cons: ✗ Manual updates (re-export to refresh)


PATH 2: GOOGLE CALENDAR API (5 minutes, real-time)
=================================================

STEP 1: Create Google Cloud Project (2 min)
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Sign in with YOUR Google account
3. Click "Select a project" → "NEW PROJECT"
4. Name it anything (e.g., "SmartMirror")
5. Wait for creation

STEP 2: Enable Calendar API (30 sec)
1. Search for "Google Calendar API"
2. Click it
3. Click blue "ENABLE" button

STEP 3: Create OAuth Credentials (2 min)
1. Go to "APIs & Services" → "Credentials" (left sidebar)
2. Click "Create Credentials" → "OAuth client ID"
3. If prompted, configure OAuth consent screen:
   - Choose "External"
   - App name: anything
   - Email: your email
   - Save
4. Back to Credentials, click "Create Credentials" → "OAuth client ID" again
5. Choose "Desktop application"
6. Click "CREATE"
7. Click "DOWNLOAD" (the JSON file)

STEP 4: Place credentials.json in project folder
1. Rename downloaded file to: credentials.json
2. Move to project folder (same level as google_calendar_api.py)

STEP 5: Install packages
```powershell
pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client
```

(You might already have these from requirements.txt)

STEP 6: Run it
```powershell
python google_calendar_api.py
```

First run: Browser opens → Sign in → Click "Allow" → Done!
Future runs: Just works automatically!

Pros: ✓ Real-time sync, ✓ Always up-to-date, ✓ No manual updates
Cons: ✗ 5 min setup (one-time)


WHICH ONE SHOULD I USE?
=======================

Use PATH 1 (.ics file) if:
- You want instant setup (literally copy a file)
- You don't mind manually exporting every month
- You prefer everything local

Use PATH 2 (Google API) if:
- You want real-time calendar data
- You're okay with 5 min setup
- You want "smart mirror" experience (always current)


TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

"credentials.json not found"
→ Make sure you downloaded it and put it in the project folder

Browser shows "Unverified app" warning
→ This is normal. Click "Go to [app name] (unsafe)" - your data is safe

"Error 403: access_denied"
→ Follow GOOGLE_CALENDAR_API_SETUP.txt to add yourself as test user

Still stuck?
→ Use PATH 1 instead (.ics file) - zero configuration!


WHAT HAPPENS TO MY DATA?
=======================

✅ Your calendar stays private
✅ Only you can access it
✅ Each person uses their own credentials
✅ credentials.json and token.json never get shared


QUESTIONS?
==========

See these files for more details:
- CALENDAR_USAGE.txt (features & examples)
- GOOGLE_CALENDAR_API_SETUP.txt (detailed setup)
- CALENDAR_API_EXPLAINED.txt (how it works)

Or just use PATH 1 - no questions needed!
