Requirements:

core python libraries:
opencv-python for UI/display (full screen mirror display, overlays, video)
pyaudio for mic input (capture audio)
elevenlabs for voice replies (text to speech)
requests for API requests (weather, calendar, etc)
python-dotenv for Config/secrets (storing API keys)

option for MVP:
speechrecognition for speech to text (converts audio to text)
python-vlc for music/video playback (handling audio/video playback with sound)
Pillow for image/text overlays (optional helper for nicer UI rendering)

Tools for Development/Environment
visual studio code (as the IDE)
python virtual environment (venv) to isolate project dependencies
requirements.txt so we all have same library versions
Python version 3.14.3

put these in a requirements.txt and everyone should run pip install -r requirements.txt
and then we need a virtual environment venv and just update requirements.txt whenever a new library is added.

pip freeze > requirements.txt keeps everyone in sync automatically
