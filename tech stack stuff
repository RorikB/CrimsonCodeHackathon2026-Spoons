Requirements:
opencv-python
pyaudio
elevenlabs
requests
python-dotenv

put these in a requirements.txt and everyone should run pip install -r requirements.txt
and then we need a virtual environment venv and just update requirements.txt whenever a new library is added.

pip freeze > requirements.txt keeps everyone in sync automatically
