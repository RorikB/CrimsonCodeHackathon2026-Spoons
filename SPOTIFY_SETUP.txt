SPOTIFY API SETUP GUIDE
=======================

1. CREATE A SPOTIFY APP:
   - Go to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
   - Log in with your Spotify account (create one if needed)
   - Click "Create an App"
   - Accept the terms and create the app
   - You'll get: Client ID and Client Secret
   - In App Settings, set Redirect URI to: https://localhost:8888/callback
   - IMPORTANT: Make sure this matches the .env file exactly!

2. SET UP YOUR .env FILE:
   Add these lines to your .env file:
   
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
   SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=https://localhost:8888/callback

3. FIRST RUN:
   - Run: python spotify_player.py
   - Spotify will automatically open if not already running
   - A browser window will open asking for Spotify login
   - Authorize the app to access your Spotify account
   - You'll be redirected to the callback URL (a blank page is normal)
   - The authorization token will be saved to .spotify_cache
   - Future runs won't require login again!

4. FEATURES & CONTROLS:
   - Displays current playing track with album cover art
   - Shows song title, artist, and album name
   - Full playback control:
     * SPACE - Play/Pause
     * N - Next track
     * P - Previous track
     * ESC - Exit player
   - Auto-opens Spotify if not running

5. HOW IT WORKS:
   - Player connects to your Spotify account and controls playback
   - Music plays through Spotify (desktop app or web player)
   - Works like a car stereo - seamless music control
   - No need to touch Spotify directly, control everything from the mirror

NOTES:
- Spotify will automatically open if it's not already running
- Login credentials are saved to .spotify_cache (you only login once!)
- The player can both display AND control your music playback
- Works with Spotify Free and Premium accounts
- Perfect for smart mirror or hands-free music control

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If controls don't work: Make sure music is playing on Spotify first
  (Play any song manually, then the controls will work from the player)
- If "No active device" error: Open Spotify and start playing any song
- The player needs an active Spotify device to control playback
- Once music is playing, all controls (SPACE/N/P) will work perfectly
